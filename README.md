# Diffraction Demo

These are the scripts needed to run the diffraction demonstration as part of the 
Neutron Trailer as part of the [ORNL Travelling Science Fair](https://orise.orau.gov/ornl-science-fair/). 

Depending on security setting and the web browser, the camera will not work when the file is loaded 
locally. If no Internet access is available, run a simple webserver by open a command prompt and 
running the command:

```
cd <directory with web pages>
python -m http.server 8080 
```

Now you can access the pages at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) from your web browser.
